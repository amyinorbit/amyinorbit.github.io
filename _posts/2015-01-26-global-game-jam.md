I am just emerging from Global Game Jam (my first game jam ever), and it was a blast. Being around all those artists and programmers coming up with different ideas was an incredible experience, only topped by how great it was to work and laugh with three amazing friends and talented artists. Our game is full of small bugs, the gameplay is not exactly the one we planned for at the beginning, but I still am immensely proud of what we've managed to make in 48 hours. Nothing could beat seeing people play and enjoy the game at the end of the Jam.
