![Marina's Love+Fear album][i1]{: .right}

Transitioning is an altogether weird experience. I'm just over two years in, and there are still things I discover every day. About my body, about the effects hormones have on it -- I now have a waist and hips, apparently! -- but also about things I realise I was never taught because I wasn't raised as a girl -- the politics of going home alone at night -- or the thousands little things that I now know were pretty good signs that I was never a boy.

There's me wondering at eight why my shoes weren't making that clacky noise that heels make. Me in high school, feeling excluded when I didn't have any period stories to complain about with my friends, who were mostly girls. Another one I've picked up on recently is Marina (and the Diamonds).



I discovered Marina's music at a time where I think I was starting to know that I wasn't a guy (even though I would never had admitted it then). I was around 20, realising how little I fitted with "the guys". We spent a good deal of time that summer playing just dance at a friend's, and as far as I can remember it's the first time I actually let myself dance (very badly) around other people without holding back. The one song that I could vaguely manage was [_Oh No!_][1], and I fell in love with it.

Back home, I started listening to Marina's then two albums (_Family Jewels_ and _Electra Heart_). It was the most stereotypically girly thing I'd done so far, and I must have known because I was almost scared of my family knowing, which seems fairly silly in hindsight unless I really knew what that meant and tried to ignore it.

When _FROOT_ came out, I'd moved to Scotland, and I'd stopped being so secretive about listening to girly things. I waited every month for the next single to drop, and I was up in front of my laptop with my debit card clutched in my hand the second the tickets for the _Neon Nature_ Glasgow dates were available. To date, it's the best gig I've ever been to.

Even though it was a whole year before I finally admitted that I was, in fact, a girl, I think that night was the first time I presented and acted as myself, ever. I got a eyeliner heart drawn on my cheek and screamed, sung and danced with everyone in the pit. I was surrounded with girls and women and felt like I belonged. Looking back, it's hard to know how much of how good I felt that night was because I got to see my favourite singer on stage, and how much of it was because I got to be myself.

I've always attached a lot of -- probably too much -- meaning to music. But Marina's will always be special to me, because it was a way for me to be feminine when even myself wouldn't have accepted it otherwise. So that's why I'm incredibly excited to listen to her next album, and so happy that I get to go see her in convert again soon, this time knowing exactly who I am and enjoying every second of it ðŸ’Ž
