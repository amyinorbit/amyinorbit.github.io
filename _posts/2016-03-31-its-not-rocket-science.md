I still can't believe I got to give a talk about rockets, but here it is! I was shaking a bit, my accent isn't as good as I wish it were, but overall I'm very proud of it. Thanks a lot to [Bill](https://twitter.com/BillYuksel), [Johanna](https://twitter.com/JoHoltan) and the whole team that worked hard to make the conference possible, it was amazing!

_You should definitely go have a look at all the [other talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsRNoUx8w3rPULtPrQbXtRYHpFop4Whko) given at TEDx Abertay University â€” they were all brilliant._
