title: See you around, 2015
---

2015 has been pretty crazy. I've stalled a bit lately when it comes to creative stuff, so I thought it would be a good idea to look back on things I've done and seen this past year (the idea came from Susan Lin's [very similar post](http://sketch.bysusanlin.com/blog/136337795023/2015-the-list)).

This is a bit less formal than I usually post here, but that's one thing I really want to do in 2016: use this blog more often, without having to (badly) write long pieces every time: I want to be able to use it more as a log than a place to post nice writing â€” which I won't stop posting when I feel like it. Happy New Year!
