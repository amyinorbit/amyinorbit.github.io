title: Gamergate has to stop
---

I love Video Games. I think they’re an incredible way for people to create innovative, beautiful, inclusive stories and universes. This is probably why I’ve always been more keen on “different”, well designed or story-driven games than shooters like _Call of Duty_.

But I think Video Games need and benefit from criticism. Every other form of media is subject to it. After all, other people’s opinion is how you realise that you’ve done something wrong. How you improve the next time. The last two months have been a nightmare for video games, and this is an understatement.

Two persons that I admire, that I look up to, have been chased from their homes by death and rape threats. [Brianna Wu][1] for trying to reach out to the “leaders” of GamerGate and [retweeting][2] a [meme][3]. [Anita Sarkeesian][4] for [advocating gender equality][5] in games. Three conferences where she was scheduled to speak received bomb threats. She had to cancel a talk at Utah State University because [someone promised a mass shooting][6] otherwise. Women have been bullied and harassed to the point some of them [left][7] [the industry][8] altogether.

This cannot go on. Even though they’re trying to mask their cause as a “concern for ethics in video games journalism”, [GamerGate started as a harassment campaign][9] on developer Zoe Quinn, and did not change since. This movement is nothing but a disgusting war on women in video games. They threaten, insult and harass anyone who opposes to them, hunting down people they call *Social Justice Warriors*[^1].

GamerGate needs to stop now. It has never been about ethics, and will never be. If someone is destroying video games right now it’s them, not the people asking for more diversity.
