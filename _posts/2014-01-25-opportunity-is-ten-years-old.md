Ten years ago today, Mars Exploration Rover B, Opportunity, landed on Mars, using a "simple" [airbag system][2].

Both Opportunity and Spirit, which had landed twenty-one days before, were designed for a 90-martian-day mission. And yet, Opportunity is still roving, taking pictures and doing scientific experiments, ten years later. That’s almost forty times longer than the planned mission.

During this ten-year long mission, the rover had time to visit six craters, inspect tens of meteorites and martian rocks, [visit its own heat shield][4], and send back some of the most impressive pictures of Mars’s terrain, and it's not over yet. Congratulations to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory teams managing the rover, and a happy birthday to Opportunity!
