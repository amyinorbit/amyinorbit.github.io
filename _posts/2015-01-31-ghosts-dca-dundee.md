![Ghosts at the DCA](/static/media/2015/01/ghosts_dca.jpg)

Today, I got to present Ghosts at a [_Drop In And Play_](http://www.dca.org.uk/whats-on/event/drop-in-and-play-jnr) event organised at [Dundee Contemporary Arts](http://www.dca.org.uk). The goal was for kids to be able to play games and chat with their developers, should they want to know more about how a game is made.

This motivated me to spend a few days last week making the game a bit more presentable than it was in June —proper full screen, a simple flickering light effect, new sprites— and the new version is available at [amyparent.com/ghosts](http://amyparent.com/ghosts).

Presenting it was amazing. Quite a lot of kids came and played, sometimes many rounds to try to top the high score, and I don't think there is anything more rewarding than them enjoying a game I made. This event and [Global Game Jam](http://amyparent.com/2015/01/global-game-jam/) make me want to make more games. I might finally start Game a Month again after all. A massive thank-you to DCA and the event's director, Clive Gillman!
