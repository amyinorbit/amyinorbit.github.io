![SpaceX ASDS - Of Course I Still Love You][ocisly]

A simple wallpaper set I made from the design painted on the decks of SpaceX's _Autonous Spaceport Droneships_. I made a version for each of the ships, [_Of Course I Still Love You_][ocisly] (used for launches out of Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center) and [_Just Read The Instructions_][jrti] (used for launches out of Vandenberg).
