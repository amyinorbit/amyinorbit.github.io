title: Why I make games

![Dare Protoplay Festival's banner][im1]

A month ago, I got a mail saying I could present Ghosts at the [Dare Protoplay festival][1]. I'd never been as a visitor, and I expected maybe a couple hundred visitors over the week end, having never been to the festival. I was wrong.

_A few of the countless visitors._

On Sunday alone, the least busy of the two days, 561 rounds of Ghosts were played. Some kids remembered the game from the [DCA event][2] in January. Some discovered it, some told me it was their favourite game. Many gave me tips on how I could make it better. Most played again and again to try and beat the high score. After two days of standing up, I was exhausted, but I still have a smile stuck on my face.

Since I started a year ago, I'd realised that I enjoyed making games, but it was more a hobby than anything else. This week-end (and [Global Game Jam][4]) made me realise that it means much more to me. I've made [amazing friends][4] with whom I spent this weekend. I've never felt anything as rewarding as someone telling you that they love your game and playing again and again. When I see that, I feel like I'm doing the right thing. I know deep down inside that I want to be a game developer.

I know it's not an easy choice. Finding a job that pays the bills in that industry is hard â€” finding a job at all is hard. But I'll take the risk. And if I find a job outside of games, that's fine. I'm lucky to also love general programming. I'll be a programmer by day, and by night I'll don my costume and be [Lightspeed Games][5]. And maybe I'll never find success, and that's alright too. If just one person has fun playing a game I made, I'll have done my job.

A massive thank-you to everyone involved in Dare for making this week-end possible, and Glyph Games for being such cool stall neighbours. To [Adriel][6] for making me want to make games a year ago. And most of all, thanks to everyone who came to play and chat. You're the reason I make games.
