This beautiful short was made without post-processing CGI of any kind. Everything was projected onto white screens, and shot with cameras. As it is often the case when magic and technology, two of my favourite things, are mixed and used together, I am totally amazed. The quote at the end of the video sums it all:

> Any Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
