Today, Elon Musk introduced SpaceX's updated plan for an inter-planetary transport system (let's
ignore the potentially gimicky Earth-Earth usage case presented at the end). In the grand scheme of
things, the rocket and spaceship are similar to what was originally shown at [IAC2016][1]: A big
reusable booster similar in concept to Falcon&nbsp;9's first stage, and a combined spacecraft and
second stage, that can be refuelled on orbit, and reenter with a combination of lifting entry and
powered landing (required for landing on most Solar System bodies).

last year, there were two concerns with SpaceX's plan: there were little to know details on the
spacecraft's life support system, particularly solar radiation shielding, and little to no plan on
how to fund the development â€“ then estimated at around ten billion dollars.

Today's announcement gave us more details on the first point: we know have at least a rough idea of
how the spacecraft is organised, and we know there's a plan for a solar storm "war room" of sorts
where passengers can shelter. And, according to Musk, the talk also explained how the system was all
going to be funded.

## The Plan

SpaceX's end goal is the same as last year: big rocket, big spacecraft (both reusable), send people
(lots of them) to live on Mars. What Musk said allowed it to be fundable this time is the scale:
last year's BFR (_Big Falcon Rocket_) was planned to be twelve metres in diameter and weigh about
6,000&nbsp;tonnes at liftoff. The updated design calls for a nine metre rocket, and about 4,500&nbsp;tonnes. The plan, then, would look something like that:

1. Develop the early stages of BFR alongside SpaceX's current line of rockets and spacecraft
   (Falcon&nbsp;9, Falcon&nbsp;Heavy, Dragon).
2. Stockpile Falcon&nbsp;9 and Falcon&nbsp;Heavy rockets and wind down production. The stockpile is
   meant to satisfy clients that wouldn't want to launch on early BFR vehicles.
3. Use BFR as SpaceX's single workhorse, launch satellites and bringing cargo to ISS, potentially
   supporting a Moon base.
4. Use the profits from (3) to fund the programme and land the first two BFR cargo crafts on Mars
   during the 2022 window, two cargo and two passenger vehicles in 2024 (_aspirational_ date).


All that, according to the presentation, for a cost inferior to any even Falcon&nbsp;1 per launch
(which were [sold for $6.7M][2] when the programme was running -- [Falcon&nbsp;9 launches are sold $62M][3] for missions where the first stage can be recovered).

## Say What?

While I love this plan on the purely technical side, and I dearly want to see humans on Mars before
I turn 80, I think there are gaping holes in the money side of things. I'll try to explain each of
them -- bear in mind, I'm neither a rocket scientist, nor a financial expert.

1. _Bezos Graphs, and the vagueness of the whole thing_: according to Musk, this presentation was
   supposed to convince everyone that there was indeed a plan to fund BFR/ITS. Yet, it was very
   vague: we know BFR is supposed to cost less per launches than Falcon&nbsp;1, but how much
   exactly? And if it does, how many launches per vehicles are required to get to that point? This
   is important, because it's hard to compare cold hard costs between expandable launchers and one
   that can potentially be reused tens of times. It seems obvious that to reach less than $6M per
   launch, each vehicle needs to launch a lot -- I'm willing to bet that the material cost for
   building a single booster and spaceship alone are far, far higher than that.
   
   I think this is a Musk problem, more than a SpaceX one. At this stage of development -- SpaceX
   is pretty far along in engine development, has started buying tooling and building a factory --
   I'm sure those calculations have been made, and are being made in the company. The contrary would
   be foolish. But then, why not show the results? Numbers are clearly not as pretty and exciting
   as videos of engine tests, but they're just as important, if not more.

2. _Development costs_: save for last year's $10Bn ballpark figure, the presentation never said
   how much SpaceX estimates will be required for the development of BFR -- that is, before they
   can use it to earn money. There again, I don't think SpaceX hasn't run the numbers. We've heard
   both Musk and Gwynne Shotwell mention that SpaceX's planned internet satellite constellation as
   a revenue source meant to finance the Mars plans, but there are still regulatory and technical
   hurdles before SpaceX can make money from that. That, and launching 4,000 satellites in Low Earth
   Orbit.

3. Satellites, ISS & the Moon: the current design of BFR calls for about 140&nbsp;tonnes of payload
   to Low Earth Orbit, without refuelling. For GTO (Geostationary Transfer Orbit), which is where
   most of the commercial satellites go, you need about 2.5km/s of velocity change from LEO.
   According to the payload graph from the presentation, that drops payload capacity to about
   25&nbsp;tonnes. Current geostationary satellites are usually between five and ten tonnes at
   launch, which means a launch could send between two and five satellites in one go.
