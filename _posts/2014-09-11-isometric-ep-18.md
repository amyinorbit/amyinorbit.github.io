If you are even remotely interested in games and tech, please go listen to this week's Isometric. The panel tackles the horrendous harassement that women in games have been suffering in the last few weeks particularly. It is a tough listen, but if as a man you feel uncomfortable listening to it, try to imagine what it must be to endure that harassment on a daily basis.

Once you've listened to this, you might also want to watch:

* Brianna Wu's talk at this year's AltConf, _Nine ways to stop hurting and start helping women in tech_ ([youtube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=XGqmneujHYY))

* The recording of _The F. Word_ panel, held this year's PAX Prime ([youtube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=3M4ay9d9758))
