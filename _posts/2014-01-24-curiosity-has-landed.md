Since Lego had said that it shouldn’t be despatched before the thirtieth of january, I was a bit surprised to find the bigger-than-expected box in the mailbox on monday.

It’s definitively an amazing Lego kit. It feels solid, sturdy, and very closely depicts the real rover. The only parts that seem likely to detach are the small pairs of Lego binoculars used to model the rover’s camera.

As I expected, the rocker bogie suspension system works like a charm, and its motion when the small robot is ran over obstacles is hypnotising. If you are even remotely interested in Space, grab one of those, it’s worth it.
