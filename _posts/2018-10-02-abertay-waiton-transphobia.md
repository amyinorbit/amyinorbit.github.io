A few days ago, Dr. Waiton, lecturer at [Abertay University][uad], published a vile transphobic opinion piece in The Herald Scotland. Abertay's support was an important part of my early transition, and this goes against the university's stance of acceptance of LGBT+ students and staff. Here's the comments I've sent as a complaint to the university. If you are in any way touched by this issue, please send your comments as well to the [Abertay SA][uadsa], and take the time to sign the [LGBT+ society's petition][pet] asking the university to put in place a zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory speech.

To Abertay leadership: while you may think a lecturer's personal "opinion" (hate speech) does not reflect your stance on inclusivity, this will reflect on the university, and this will impact transgender and gender non-conforming students and staff. Please do not let it pass.

> I am a transgender woman working on my PhD at Abertay. I started transitioning when I was finishing my undergraduate degree, and felt comfortable doing so because of Abertay and UADSA’s openly supportive LGBTQ+ policies, as well as the support and help that my lecturers and now supervisors offered (as part of then-AMG, now SDI). I found Dr. Waiton’s article transphobic and distressing, and at odds with the open, supporting environment that Abertay seems to be sporting.

> I am worried about possibly having to interact with Dr. Waiton in the future as part of my academic career at Abertay. Views and articles like these proclaiming that dysphoria is a fad and that transition is the result of wanting to feel part of some online communities are exactly why it took me so long to accept that I was transgender, and why I still struggle with feelings that I am not a woman “enough” today. The current anti-transphobic police Scotland campaign is derided in the article as an attack on “beliefs”, but those beliefs state that I should not be allowed to express myself as a woman.

> Had I had lecturers be openly against transgender rights while I was studying for my BSc, I would have felt considerably worse than I was already feeling because of dysphoria. I would not have felt it was safe for me to come out to my lecturers and transition.
