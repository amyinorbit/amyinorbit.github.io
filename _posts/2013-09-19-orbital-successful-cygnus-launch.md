Yesterday, Orbital Sciences succeeded in launching its first ISS resupply spacecraft, the Cygnus. It is the second successful launch from Orbital Sciences this month (the first one was a Minotaur-5, [carrying the LADEE Moon orbiter][3]), and the second (and successful) launch of their Antares rocket, an "hybrid" rocket: while the first stage is liquid-fueld (RP-1 kerosene and liquid oxygen), the second stage, made by ATK, is a solid-rocket motor.

This isn't, by far, the second launch from Orbital Sciences, but it is one of their most critical ones: whereas all their other launch vehicle are based on proven ICBMs, Antares is a complete new design.

After five days of tests in orbit, the Cygnus is to become the second commercial spacecraft to berth with the ISS, after SpaceX'x Dragon a bit more than a year ago.
