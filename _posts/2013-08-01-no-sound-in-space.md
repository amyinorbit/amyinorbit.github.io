Colonel Chris Hadfield, who [shared on twitter][1] his six month experience aboard the ISS and recorded the [highest-flying Bowie cover][2], talks on Soundcloud about the sounds of the Space Station, from the ambiant air pumps and fans to the screeching docking of a Soyuz Spacecraft. Fascinating, if you ask me.
