I live on music. I don't —and I cannot— spend one single day without having music around me. While coding, working, playing, walking, whether it is my iTunes library or a crappy live recording on YouTube, through speakers or headphones, it doesn't matter. I though I'd have a look at what has been playing on my iTunes the most often for the last few weeks[^1].

## Marina & The Diamonds

This was not really a surprise to see that pop up. I discovered Marina's music roughly two month ago, and I fell in love with it. Not love at first sight: that kind of love that comes slowly, as you try to listen again to that song, that had a passage you liked. And you end up listening to everything, almost all the time.

If I had to pick three songs, I would choose _Oh No!_ for its energy, _Hermit the Frog_ for the leaps in the tone of her voice, and, above all, the acoustic version of _Homewrecker_, also for the oh–so–perfect voice.

## Franz Ferdinand (Right Thoughts, etc.)

Not a big surprise either: I have known them for quite long, but the release of their new album also made me go back through their whole discography.

My three favourite songs from _Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action_ would be _Fresh Strawberries_, for its fake slowness and the beautiful vocals, along with the two title/singles _Right Action_ (which intro always reminds me of _Forever Man_, from Clapton) and _Love Illumination_.

## Vintage Trouble

I had never  heard of them until July, when they played a few hours before the Stones in Hyde Park. A great soul/funk/r&b concert, which made me buy the album. It stayed quite unplayed until a month ago, but I must admit it is now growing on me. Beautiful voice, a great guitar sound, nice melodies…

This time, I'd pick _Nobody Told Me_, _Nancy Lee_ and _Total Strangers_.

Surprisingly, the list did not include any song by Clapton, and only two by the Rolling Stones. It might be due to the fact that I rebuilt my iTunes library (and thus the play counts) when I got my new computer a month ago. Or that I am becoming less of a music snob. Yay!

[^1]: Even though I more or less know without having to check, I tried using an iTunes Smart Playlist: the 25 most played songs, last played less than a week ago. unfortunately, iTunes doesn't give you a way to get the plays count for a limited range of time.
