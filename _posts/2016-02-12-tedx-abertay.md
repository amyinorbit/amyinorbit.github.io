> After humanity took its first steps in space, it only took us eight years to reach the Moon. Yet, nearly forty-five years after Apollo 11, our furthest outpost is the International Space Station, 400km above ground. The rocket that Tim Peake rode in december was nearly the same as the one that took Yuri Gagarin to space in 1961.

> Why are there still only six people living in Space? Why are Mars missions still decades away? The talk explains why we need to use rockets to get to space, what makes them so expensive, and what could change â€” It's not rocket science

I'm not saying I'm freaking out about giving a TEDx talk, but I'm not saying I'm not.
