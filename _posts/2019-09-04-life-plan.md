Secret Life Awesome Plan
========================

SLAP. Because this plan SLAPs. Or *26 is as good a time as any to have a quarter-life crisis and rethink my priorities I guess?*

**Short(ish) term**

* Apply and (fingers crossed) obtain EU settled status in the UK
* Finish that darn PhD (with which I have a love-hate-hate relationship)
* Learn to love roller derby again
* Go see Garbage live (hey, small victories)
* Start writing again. Fiction, non-fiction, here.

**Medium term**

* Find a job (or postdoc, maybe?) hopefully programming or in aerospace
* Move to Glasgow (for the queer community and the general atmosphere)
* Find a place I actually love and make it mine (all the plants ðŸŒ±)
* Start saving (never too late to start right?)
    
**Long term**

* Get Scottish citizenship (within or out of the UK)
* Open a cute, queer coffee shop/snack place/workspace. Run it. (code/do research in my spare time)
* Buy (?) my own place.
* Skate for Team Scotland Roller Derby (I never said it had to be realistic)
* Adopt or foster

It's a bit strange how sudden but also how right this felt when it popped in my head and I decided to write it down. If you'd asked me a year ago I'd have never *ever* thought space or programming wouldn't be my long term career goal, but this feels so much more *right*. So much more me. Not that I'll ever stop writing code, making games and hopefully research space on my spare time. But the idea of running a queer place that I can be proud of makes me dream 1,000% more than writing code for a boss my entire life.
