# An Ode to Inconceivable!

![Inconceivable cover art](/static/media/2020/1115-incon_ceivable.jpg){: .left}

Quarantine has been (still is, really) hard. I live on my own, and as much as I can be very introverted at times, I draw a *lot* of my energy from interacting with my friends. I am also a pretty tactile person, so, there's that. Suffice to say, I haven't had the most sparkliest time these last 9 months (still, everyone. Stay home. Wear a mask. It works).

With time I've come up with a variety of coping mechanisms: reading (a lot of) fanfiction, books, drawing, binging shows, long calls with my best pals. Another one of these things is [*Inconceivable*][incon]. {% include note.html text="Notice how \"work\" and \"writing my thesis\" doesn't feature at all in that list? Yeah, me neither." %} I've known and listened to this podcast for ages now, but it's been a really nice way to escape and just laugh -- I'm pretty sure I've listened to all the episodes again at least twice in the last nine months.

> Inconceivable! is a show that tests our panelistsâ€™ knowledge of the nerdy, the useless, and the obscure. Each episode, two teams face off to answer diabolical questions about TV shows, comics, movies, books, games, and more. Host Dan Moren and scorekeeper/announcer Lex Friedman oversee the proceedings, doling out hard-earned points where appropriate.

*Inconceivable* is essentially a trivia panel show. But instead of it being about science, literature, sports and history, it's nerdy films, TV and books, betting points on fake definitions, and outrageous, delightful punny movie title mashups. Dan Moren hosts, and Lex Friedman usually keeps the scores. Most of all, it's *so much fun*.

The guests on the show all know each other (they're all members of the [Incomparable][mothership] nerdy podcast network), and I think that's what makes the game so fun to listen to: after a couple episodes, it feels like you know them. You know Liz Myles will find the answer seemingly out of nowhere, Steve Lutz will add "You fake off!" when the Fake-Off round begins, someone will groan at one of Dan's puns. I am fully aware that this paragraph must read like inane rambling, but I genuinely don't think any description can do justice to how funny this show is. I have laughed so much I've cried at it.

I wish I had a more concise and put-together point, but really, the only thing I'd like to say is: go listen to Inconceivable. If you like fantasy, sci-fi, and puns, you *will* love it. If you don't know where to start, I would recommend ["There are no hamburgers in the Phantom Zone"][ep78]: the episode devolves into beautiful chaos and has had me crying every time I've listened to it, and includes some 10/10 Schwarzeneger impersonations.
