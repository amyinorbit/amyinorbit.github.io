title: The Art of Making, Alma Flamenca
---

It takes Alma Flamenca 299 hours of work to make one flamenco guitar. But what fascinates me here isn't the time it takes. Those small controlled, perfected gestures, the way his hands move makes me shiver. You can feel the years of practise behind each action. Nothing is superfluous.

The way hands move when they're controlled by expertise has always fascinated me. that is probably why I can watch concert videos for hours, just watching musicians hands move on keyboards and guitar necks.
