I've been working on this small set of pixel art covers/cases/t-shirts for a while now. I'm a big fan of (inter)planetary exploration, so I though I'd pay an homage in my own way â€”pixels.

I've finished four: [Mars Exploration Rovers](http://www.redbubble.com/people/amyparent/works/13232067-space-pixels-mars-exploration-rovers), on Mars for now more than eleven years, [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://www.redbubble.com/people/amyparent/works/14145347-space-pixels-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter) (which HiRise camera provides us with [stunning views of Mars landscape](http://amyparent.com/2013/09/1-hirise-pictures/)), [Rosetta/Philae](http://www.redbubble.com/people/amyparent/works/13276515-space-pixels-rosetta-and-philae), currently orbiting comet 67P, and [Voyager 1](http://www.redbubble.com/people/amyparent/works/13230470-space-pixels-voyager-1?c=342597-space-pixels), the furthest reaching human-made object to date.

There's a few more missions that I plan on adding. I'm thinking Curiosity, Cassini (Saturn system), maybe Mangalyaan and the Chang'e probes. The list is not definitive though, and I'm more than open to suggestions!
