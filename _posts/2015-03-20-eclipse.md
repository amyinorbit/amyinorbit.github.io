Dundee was nice to us this morning, and the few clouds that were threatening the eclipse backed away five minutes after the Moon started passing in front of the Sun. It was amazing seeing the Sun become nothing but a thin crescent and the light slowly dim.

I even managed to get a few photographs by holding the eclipse glasses in front of my iPhone's camera, and fighting with the autofocus to get a sharp enough shot. They're quite blurry, but still good enough to show the progression from the start to maximum magnitude â€”about 90% here in Scotland.
