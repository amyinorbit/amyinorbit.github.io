My name is Amy, and I'm trans
=============================


I know, the change in name and URL of the blog might've been a bit of a giveaway. I've gone by by another name for the first twenty-three years of my life, but this is who I am, and this is who I've always been. It's just taken me a while to figure it out.

I'm transgender. In the past few months, I've learnt to come to terms with this, to accept it. I've known for years, probably -- although everything seems a lot clearer in hindsight. I've doubted my gender, for a while, and that part is certain. I've never really liked my body, I'd wished so many times I hadn't been born a boy (spoiler: I haven't!). I'd always assumed that you had to feel full-on _body dysphoria_ 100% of the time to "qualify" as trans (a feeling which the NHS webpage on dysphoria never helped with).

For me, it wasn't as clear-cut. Dysphoria is definitely a thing, and some days it can be crippling. But since February, I've also discovered gender "euphoria": knowing and saying I'm a girl, presenting as a girl feels right. This, and the incredibly safe environment that is Abertay, has helped me a lot accept who I am in the past few months.

Coming out is a strange thing to deal with. On a day-to-day basis, I evolve in a very LGBTQ-aware world, and it's easy for me to forget that a lot of the people I know and am coming out to may not even know what "transgender" means. So to help with that, I've tried to come up with a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.

## What should I call you/What pronouns should I use?

Amy, and "she", "her" or whichever applies in the context. If you've known me for months or years by my birth name, I'm super aware that it's a big change and that it won't happen overnight. Heck, I misgender myself and still use my birth name by accident (especially in French, because French is an awful language for gender).

## What does transgender mean?

A transgender person is a person whose gender (how they feel) does not match the gender marker that was assigned to them at birth based on their biological sex. In my case, I'm a trans(gender) girl/woman, which means I was "assigned male at birth" (you might see that called AMAB in places). The opposite of a transgender person is a cisgender person (a person whose gender matches their assigned biological sex).

## So you're becoming a girl?

Nope, I've always been a girl. You didn't know (and even I might not have) but I always was.

## Is it because you like men?

Nope. Gender identity is not the same as sexual orientation. I'm still fuzzy as to what I am on _that_ spectrum -- I've mostly had feelings for girls, but I've been attracted to men before. In the end, it's more someone's personality that does it. Anyway, I digress.

## Are you going to have SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery)

That's a personal thing. You probably don't mean any harm by asking. Asking that question has somehow been normalised by talk show hosts asking trans people, but look at it this way: it would be completely out of place if you went to any cisgender friend and randomly asked them about what's in their underwear.
