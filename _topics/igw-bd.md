Brown dwarfs are objects halfway between planets and stars. Brown dwarfs that have been observed often vary in brightness, which could be caused by their magnetic fields, or by clouds obscuring their light. Computer simulations show that weather and atmospheric waves in brown dwarfs could have a strong impact on the way clouds form and evolve in their atmosphere. Atmospheric (gravity) waves are waves created by wind and turbulence in the air (on Earth) and other atmospheres, just like waves in the ocean. We simulated gravity waves in the computer model of a brown dwarfs' atmosphere to calculate how they change the speed at which titanium dust grains are created.

We find that with the passage of waves, dust clouds form much faster (up to 20 times) than without. We also find that the waves cause the clouds to form in distinct stripes, and that the distance between those stripes is linked to how dense and warm the atmosphere is. Looking at a wide range of types of brown dwarfs, we find that gravity waves cause the striped clouds to have higher contrast in cooler, higher-pressure brown dwarfs.

Observing the striped clouds created by gravity waves isn't possible with current telescope, but might become possible in the future. Since the properties of the stripes (contrast, distance between stripes) depend on the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, this could give us more information on the atmosphere of brown dwarfs.
