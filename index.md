*I'm working on adding more fleshed-out pages for research and projects. This should be done in the next few weeks!*

## Research

I'm currently doing a PhD in astrophysics and Computer Science. I model how weather and magnetic fields shape the formation and evolution of dust clouds in brown dwarfs, using modern computing technologies.

For my undergraduate dissertation, I developed a hardware and software platform for modular high-altitude balloon missions, inspired by the common buses that commercial satellites use. I designed and tested the hardware bus around a micro-controller, defined protocols for radio and internal communications, and wrote the flight software using a real time OS.

## Projects

I have a saying that my projects have side projects have side projects have side projects... and it's fairly accurate. Currently, the projects (outside of my research) that I've been working on the most are:

 * Orbit, a small programming language. I'm fascinated by programming languages and by tools people use to make things in general, and I *love* reinventing the wheel, so writing my own language from scratch (VM runtime and compiler) in C is a kind of heaven for me.
 
 * Various game engines in various states of abandon. I wrote Meteor years ago, a thing C++ layer around SDL2 that powered a handful of game jam games, and I'm currently (very slowly) trying to build a more modern, more flexible, ECS-based engine.
