Hiya! I'm Amy Parent
====================

![A photo of Amy Parent (she/her)]({{ site.avatar }}){:.mug .right}

I'm a flight simulation developer based in Edinburgh. I'm a queer trans woman (my pronouns are she/her) and I've been fascinated by space since I was a kid ðŸš€

For my work, I make planes for X-Plane. I develop a replica of the UNS-1 Flight Management System, which ships with  FlyJSim's Q4XP, and other planes in the future.

In my spare time, I play video games, make programming languages, and record bad covers of Marina & The Diamonds and Garbage songs. I play roller derby with Auld Reekie Roller Derby, with whom I collect bruises, sore legs and amazing friends.
