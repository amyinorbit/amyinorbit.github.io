I recently got myself an iPad and a pencil with the express intent of drawing more. With lockdown still going and my mental health taking a hit, I've found that drawing is something that helps me a lot. I can switch my brain off, listen to music or chat with friends while doing it, and it exercises some completely different part of my brain.

I remembered seeing the #DrawYourNudes trend on art twitter months ago, and thought it might be something fun to do. Spending a few hours drawing my body made me realise that for the first time in my life, I truly love my body. It's not perfect, and there are things I’d still like to change, but I still love it.

I still feel a tad weird about putting a drawing which is essentially me, mostly naked, online. But I’m proud of my body, and I wish more trans people got to feel this way. Our bodies are weaponised by transphobes. The vast majority of mainstream fiction that features trans characters tells us our bodies are disgusting, ugly, wrong. Well, this is mine. It’s beautiful, as is everyone’s body. It’s trans. It’s me, and I love myself.
